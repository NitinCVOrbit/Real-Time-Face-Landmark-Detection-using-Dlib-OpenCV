# 🎯 Real-Time Face Landmark Detection using Dlib & OpenCV

This project performs **real-time face detection and facial landmark prediction** using **Dlib** and **OpenCV** in Python.  
It detects faces from a video/webcam and predicts **68 facial landmark points** such as eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, and jawline.

This is a fundamental Computer Vision project used in:
- Face Recognition
- Emotion Detection
- Head Pose Estimation
- AR Face Filters
- Driver Monitoring Systems
